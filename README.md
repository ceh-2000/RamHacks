# SOS-SMS

This app makes it easier for a manager to keep track of employees in times of crisis. Our goal was to implement a scalable safety solution for companies with work environments that could potentially become hazardous at any given time. In order to achieve our goal, we decided to experiment with multiple platforms including hardware, mobile application development, web development, and much more. While using cutting edge technology, we also wanted to ensure that our solution would be accessible to all employees regardless of their technological background.
